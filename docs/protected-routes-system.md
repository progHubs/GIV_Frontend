# Protected Routes System

## Overview

The GIV Society frontend implements a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system with three levels of access:

1. **Public Access** - No authentication required
2. **Authenticated User Access** - Login required
3. **Admin Access** - Admin role required

## Route Structure

### üåê Public Routes (No Authentication Required)

These routes are accessible to all visitors, including unauthenticated users:

- **`/`** - Homepage with hero section and features overview
- **`/campaigns`** - View all donation campaigns (read-only)
- **`/events`** - View all community events (read-only)
- **`/posts`** - View blog posts and news (read-only)
- **`/login`** - User login page
- **`/register`** - User registration page
- **`/forgot-password`** - Password reset request
- **`/reset-password/:token`** - Password reset with token
- **`/unauthorized`** - Access denied page

### üîê Authenticated User Routes

These routes require user authentication but are available to all logged-in users:

- **`/dashboard`** - User dashboard with personal statistics and activity
- **`/profile`** - User profile management and settings

**Dashboard Features:**
- Personal donation history
- Registered events overview
- Volunteer hours tracking
- Impact statistics
- Quick action buttons

**Profile Features:**
- Personal information editing
- Account settings
- Activity summary
- Password change
- Notification preferences

### üëë Admin Routes

These routes require admin role and provide administrative functionality:

- **`/admin`** - Admin dashboard with system overview

**Admin Dashboard Features:**
- System-wide statistics (users, donations, events, campaigns)
- User management tools
- Content management (campaigns, events, posts)
- System status monitoring
- Quick administrative actions

## Implementation Details

### ProtectedRoute Component

The `ProtectedRoute` component handles access control:

```typescript
interface ProtectedRouteProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  requiredRole?: UserRole;
  requireAuth?: boolean;
  redirectTo?: string;
}
```

**Usage Examples:**

```jsx
// Authenticated user route
<Route 
  path="/dashboard" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <DashboardPage />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>

// Admin-only route
<Route 
  path="/admin" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute requiredRole="admin">
      <AdminDashboardPage />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>
```

### Authentication Flow

1. **Unauthenticated Access**: Users can browse public content
2. **Login Required**: Redirects to `/login` with return URL
3. **Role Check**: Verifies user role for admin routes
4. **Unauthorized Access**: Redirects to `/unauthorized` page

### Navigation System

#### PublicLayout Navigation
- Home, Campaigns, Events, Posts, About
- Login/Register buttons for unauthenticated users
- User menu for authenticated users

#### PrivateLayout Navigation
- Dashboard (always visible to authenticated users)
- Public pages (Home, Campaigns, Events)
- Admin link (only visible to admin users)
- User profile and logout options

## Testing the System

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Public Access**: Visit public routes without logging in
2. **Authentication**: Try accessing protected routes while logged out
3. **User Access**: Login as regular user and test dashboard/profile
4. **Admin Access**: Login as admin and test admin dashboard
5. **Role Restrictions**: Try accessing admin routes as regular user

### Expected Behaviors

- ‚úÖ Public routes accessible to all
- ‚úÖ Protected routes redirect to login when unauthenticated
- ‚úÖ Admin routes show unauthorized for non-admin users
- ‚úÖ Proper navigation based on user role
- ‚úÖ Smooth user experience with loading states

## Conclusion

The protected routes system provides a solid foundation for role-based access control while maintaining excellent user experience. The modular design allows for easy extension and customization as the application grows.
